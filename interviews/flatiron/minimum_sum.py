"""
We want to find pair of indexes that subtracted gave us a desired difference. 
Create a function that given an array of integers and a desired difference returns the pair of indexes that met the condition.
 
Restrictions 
First element of tuple should always be lesser than second element 
Valid tuple examples: (0,1), (0, 10), (1, 3) 
Invalid tuple examples: (1,0), (3,2) 
While traversing numbers list, order of elements evaluated should not be inverted to test for desired difference (Difference should be calculated as i â€“ j where i is the element first located in list) 
Desired difference may be negative 
Desired difference may be 0 
Numbers list may contain negative numbers 
List will only contain integers
